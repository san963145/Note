call()   apply()

In JavaScript, functions are objects. JavaScript functions have properties and methods.

call() and apply() are predefined JavaScript function methods. Both methods can be used to invoke a function,
and both methods must have the owner object as first parameter.


function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}
myObject = myFunction.call(myObject, 10, 2);

myArray = [10, 2];
myObject = myFunction.apply(myObject, myArray);
